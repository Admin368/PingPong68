 8051 Ping Pong Game in C
 by Admin368 
 This Project was to replicate the famous game of Ping Pong on an 8x8 led Matrix using an 8051 Microcontroller.
 It slowly evolved to include key controls implementation, 2 player functionality,
 basic score record keeping and intermediate Ai player option to allow one player to play with the game itself.
