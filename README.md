 This Project was to replicate the famous game of Ping Pong on an 8x8 led Matrix using an 8051 Microcontroller.
 It slowly evolved to include key controls implementation, 2 player functionality,
 basic score record keeping and intermediate Ai player option to allow one player to play with the game itself.

#HardwareRequirements
 This Ping Pong Recreation was done on YF-K1 board, running a 89C52RC chip and coded in C programming Language.
 Apart from the Board and Chip the other components used were:
 - 8x8 Led Matrix
 - 4 push buttons
 - And 8 individual Leds
 The Wiring Diagram and Schematics are present for reference attached with the other files in the project files.
